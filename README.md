# Netflix-Clone(User Interface):HTML & CSS
Welcome to my Netflix clone project built using HTML and CSS! 

In this project, I've recreated the user interface of Netflix, allowing users to experience a similar browsing and viewing experience. Leveraging HTML for structure and CSS for styling, I've aimed to mimic the layout, design, and functionality of the popular streaming platform.

Features:

# Responsive design: Ensures seamless viewing experience across devices.
# Grid layout: Organizes content similar to Netflix's interface for easy navigation.
# Custom styling: Recreated Netflix's aesthetic using CSS for a visually appealing interface.
# Static content: Mimics Netflix's content structure without actual video playback.
# Explore the code and feel free to contribute or provide feedback. Happy coding and happy streaming! 🚀

PS: Here in this project, I have given the pictures and videos regarding the same project but in the code some where i used the links that are available on Netflix Website, you can either use these downloaded stuff or you can go through the links also. Make sure to download a copy of these media for the future purpose.

Thanks
