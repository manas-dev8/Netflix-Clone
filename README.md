# Netflix-Clone: HTML & CSS
Welcome to my Netflix clone project built using HTML and CSS! 🎬🍿

In this project, I've recreated the user interface of Netflix, allowing users to experience a similar browsing and viewing experience. Leveraging HTML for structure and CSS for styling, I've aimed to mimic the layout, design, and functionality of the popular streaming platform.

Features:

Responsive design: Ensures seamless viewing experience across devices.
Grid layout: Organizes content similar to Netflix's interface for easy navigation.
Custom styling: Recreated Netflix's aesthetic using CSS for a visually appealing interface.
Static content: Mimics Netflix's content structure without actual video playback.
Explore the code and feel free to contribute or provide feedback. Happy coding and happy streaming! 🚀📺
